# AdvGame
This is a simple text based game created using python. The two reasons for this game are just to have fun and increase my knowledge of the python language.

Some things that need to be added:
1. Add more monsters
2. Add more weapons
3. Add more armors
4. Add more items 
5. Quests & general story of the game


How to run game:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the AdvGame.py with the correct program
