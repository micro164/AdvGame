# AdvGame
This is a simple text based game created using python. The two reasons for this game are just to have fun and increase my knowledge of the python language.

Some things that need to be added:
1. A forest to explore
2. Add enemies in the forest
3. Quests & general story of the game
4. Double check store and fix any issues 

How to run game:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the AdvGame.py with the correct program
