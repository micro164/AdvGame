# AdvGame
This is a simple text based game created using python. The two reasons for this game are just to have fun and increase my knowledge of the python language.

Some things that need to be added:
1. Inventory
2. More advanced healer
3. A forest to explore
4. Enemys in the forest
5. Quests

More will be added once these 5 things are done.
